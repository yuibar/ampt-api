## Welcome to Ampt!

[<img src="https://getampt.com/button"/>](https://ampt.dev/start?template=ampt-api)

To run this app locally, simply clone down this repository and run `ampt`. You may need to login to the Ampt CLI if you haven't already (you can install this by running `npm install -g @ampt/cli`). To start the local development server, run `ampt dev` or `dev` in the Ampt shell.

`@ampt/api` is _experimental_! It is not yet ready for production use. If you have any feedback, please let us know by opening an issue on this repository, or by reaching out to us on [Discord](https://getampt.com/discord). Check out the [Ampt API docs](https://getampt.com/docs/api/) for more information.

Happy coding!
